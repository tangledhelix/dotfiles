I like Neovim.

But it just isn't updated to a useful level on a ton of servers I use...
maybe this will be of more use in the future... but for now I'd just be
switching from Vim to Neovim... it's better to just use Vim everywhere...

These files are here for a future use. For now I'm not really bothering
to install them anywhere, though.
