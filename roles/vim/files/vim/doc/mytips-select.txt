Selections and matching on things

  B matches a block, so in a block you can say (a is "around" or
  "this block plus enclosing delimiters, if any")
      >aB     ident the current block
      <aB     outdent the current block
      daB     delete current block
      caB     change current block

  viw     select a word ("word" delimited not whitespace-delimited)
  viW     select a word, whitespace delimited

  gv      reselect last selection

  o       (in visual block mode) move cursor to another corner of the
          select area (to control which corner you're resizing from).

Text object selections

After a command like d (delete) or c (change) you can supply delimiters
like brackets, braces.

<img src="foo-bar-baz.jpg" alt="whatever" />

  di>
  # delete inner angle-bracket
  # results in: <>

  da>
  # delete all-inclusive angle-bracket
  # results in entire thing being removed.

  ci>
  # change inner angle-bracket
  # wipes out contents, leaving you in insert mode inside to replace it.

  ca>
  # change all-inclusive angle-bracket
  # wipes out the entire tag, leaving you in insert mode to replace it.

  # you can use either delimiter in the pair, < or >, ( or ), { or },
  # [ or ] ....

  # w matches a puncuation-delimited word
  # W matches a space-delimited word
