Folds

  zo      open closed fold under cursor
  zc      close current fold region
  zR      open "(R)ip open?" all folds
  zM      close "(M)inimize?" all folds

Fold method

  :set foldmethod=<method>

  manual, indent, expr, marker, syntax, diff

  marker: three opening, three closing, curly braces
  indent: uses indent levels
  syntax: uses syntax information for current syntax

  indent is handy for large nested files like YAML or similar if they're
  out of control.

  See |'foldmethod'| for more.
