Search and replace

  *       search for the word under the cursor
  #       ... and in reverse
  gd      go to declaration of variable under the cursor
  [I      Show lines containing word under cursor

  f<c>    jump to next occurrence of char <c>                     ("Find")
  F<c>    ... and in reverse

  t<c>    jump to position *left* of next occurrence of char <c>  ("unTil")
  T<c>    ... and in reverse

  e       go to end of word (also works with v, c, d, etc.)
  b       go to beginning of word

  q/      Open search history window to edit/use search history
  ctrl-f  From search input field, switch to search history window

  /foo/e          search for foo, placing cursor at end of match

  :%g/foo/m$      move all lines matching foo to end of file
                      % = global search
                      g = command
                      /foo/ = regex
                      m = move
                      $ = to end
                  you can do the same things with a NOT search
                  (conVerse) using v instead of g.

  :%g/foo/s/bar/zzz/g     for each line /foo/, replace bar with zzz.

  :s/foo/bar/     search/replace this line
  :%s/foo/bar/    search/replace entire file
      add g (/g) to end for global (also see :help gdefault)

  :s/\%V_/ /g     Add \%V to limit action to a *block* selection (by
                  default entire lines are affected even in ^v mode).

  :%s/\ r//g      Remove all the ^M from a file
  :%s/\ r$//g     Remove ^M only at the end of a line

  :s!/usr/local/!/opt/alt/!       Use delimiter other than /

  &       repeat last :s command
