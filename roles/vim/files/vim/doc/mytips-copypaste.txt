Copy and paste

  yyp     duplicate this line

  ddP     delete line, then paste *back into place* leaving copy on buffer
          though that's the same as yy isn't it?

  y       yank
  Y       yank line (isn't this the same as yy ?)

  cc      cut entire line and enter insert mode ("change line")

  :registers   Show what is in the current registers
  "2p          Paste contents of current register

  P       paste above/before cursor, not after/below as with "p"
  "0p     paste last explicitly copied text, not the cut buffer
  "*p     paste from system clipboard (if extant, e.g. on a Mac)
  :reg    show list of registers that can be pasted with "<n>p
