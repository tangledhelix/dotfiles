Completion and expansion

  To auto-complete what you are typing (words, variable names, etc.),
  type part of the word and use ctrl-n or ctrl-p to show completions.
  If there is only one match it is auto-inserted.

  Keep using ctrl-n or ctrl-p until you have the one you want, then
  keep typing, hit Esc, whatever.

  ctrl-n          Next match in completion mode
  ctrl-p          Previous match in completion mode

When completing, ctrl-y to accept match, ctrl-e to cancel

  ctrl-x ctrl-l   Whole-line completion mode (instead of words)
  ctrl-x ctrl-o   Syntax-aware omnicomplete

  ctrl-x ctrl-f   Complete a local filesystem filename

  And when completing something like a file path for :e ...

  ctrl-d          Show possible expansions on current completion
