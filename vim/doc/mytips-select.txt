Selections and matching on things

    B matches a block, so in a block you can say (a is 'around' or
    'this block plus enclosing delimiters, if any')
        >aB     ident the current block
        <aB     outdent the current block
        daB     delete current block
        caB     change current block

    viw     select a word ('word' delimited not whitespace-delimited)
    viW     select a word, whitespace delimited

    gv      reselect last selection

    o       (in visual block mode) move cursor to another corner of the
            select area (to control which corner you're resizing from).

Text object selections

After a command like d (delete) or c (change) you can supply delimiters
like brackets, braces.

<img src="foo-bar-baz.jpg" alt="whatever" />

    di>
    # delete inner angle-bracket
    # results in: <>

    da>
    # delete all-inclusive angle-bracket
    # results in entire thing being removed.

    ci>
    # change inner angle-bracket
    # wipes out contents, leaving you in insert mode inside to replace it.

    ca>
    # change all-inclusive angle-bracket
    # wipes out the entire tag, leaving you in insert mode to replace it.

    # you can use either delimiter in the pair, < or >, ( or ), { or },
    # [ or ] ....

    # w matches a puncuation-delimited word
    # W matches a space-delimited word
