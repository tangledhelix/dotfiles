|:g| globally applies the subsequent command to all lines matching a regex.

|:v| is the same as :v but operates on the conVerse, lines that do not match
the regex.

Address prefixing:

:.,+21g/foo/d       delete any lines matching /foo/ from current + 21 lines

:.,$v/bar/d         delete any lines from here to EOF not matching /bar/

Can mix this with |:s| and/or |:%| do to stuff like this:

:%g/foo/s/bar/zzz/g

For every line containing 'foo', substitute all 'bar' with 'zzz'.

'm' to move
'j' to join

:%g/foo/m$      Move all lines matching /foo/ to end of file,
                while preserving their original ordering.

===========================================================================

How to affect lines surrounding your match. Example:

"I want to delete the line 'Did not get valid lat and long', the line before
it, and the line after it, everywhere in this text file, from within vim."

:g/Did not get valid lat and long/-,/Did not get valid lat and long/+ d

This deletes from the first pattern to the second.

    Pattern 1: /Did not get valid lat and long/-
    Pattern 2: /Did not get valid lat and long/+

The trailing + and - mean the line before and the line after the match. So this
deletes the line before through the line after (and the line in the middle just
gets killed as a side effect).
