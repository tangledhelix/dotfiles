Navigating / jumping around

    ^       beginning of line ignoring leading whitespace (vs. "0")
    g_      end of line ignoring trailing whitespace (vs "$")

    [{      jump back to opening brace of the current code block

    H       high (top) line on this page
    M       middle line on this page
    L       low (bottom) line on this page

    zt      keep cursor in place, but move that line to top of view
    zz      keep cursor in place, but move that line to middle of view
    zb      keep cursor in place, but move that line to bottom of view

    (, )    jump to start, end of current "sentence"
    {, }    jump to start, end of current "paragraph"

    `.      return to last line you edited
    '.      return to last line you edited
    ``      return to last jump point (same as ^o)

    g;      go to position of last change (again to go to change before...)
    g,      move through changelist in opposite direction

    ^o      move backward through jump list
    ^i      move forward through jump list
