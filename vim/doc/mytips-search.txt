Search and replace

    *       search for the word under the cursor
    #       ... and in reverse

    gd      go to declaration of variable under the cursor

    " 'find'
    f<c>    jump to next occurrence of char <c>
    F<c>    ... and in reverse
    " 'til' or 'until'
    t<c>    jump to position *left* of next occurrence of char <c>
    T<c>    ... and in reverse

    e       go to end of word (also works with v, c, d, etc.)
    b       go to beginning of word

    ctrl-d  Show possible expansions on current completion

    :%g/foo/m$      move all lines matching foo to end of file
                        % = global search
                        g = command
                        /foo/ = regex
                        m = move
                        $ = to end
                    you can do the same things with a NOT search
                    (conVerse) using v instead of g.

    :%g/foo/s/bar/zzz/g     for each line /foo/, replace bar with zzz.

    :s/foo/bar/     search/replace this line
    :%s/foo/bar/    search/replace entire file
        add g (/g) to end for global (also see :help gdefault)

    :s/\%V_/ /g     Add \%V to limit action to a *block* selection (by
                    default entire lines are affected even in ^v mode).

    &       repeat last :s command
